# Question-Answering-System
Proposed an e-commerce question answering system using Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques that learns product information from product reviews and descriptions. Then, the system accordingly crafts appropriate responses to the questions asked by customer about the product. Finally, created a Full-Stack Application to display the result.

# Abstract
Online shopping (e-commerce) marketplaces have begun to have an increasingly large impact and footprint on society today. An important aspect of the e-commerce experience is the consumer’s ability to get relevant information about products and services. Getting accurate information about the product allows consumers to make informed decisions and encourages them to return to the platform for future purchases. Today, there are different ways a consumer can get information about a product online, such as reading the product description, reading through others’ reviews, and posing questions on the online marketplace forum. Oftentimes, the product descriptions provided by the vendor do not accurately reflect the quality and utility of the product. Additionally, it is painstaking to comb through many product reviews to find an answer to a question. Due to these challenges, directly posing questions about a product on the website is slowly becoming the preferred method. The current issue with this approach, however, is that most consumers prefer writing reviews than answering questions. Hence, most questions go unanswered. This project proposed an e-commerce question answering(Q&A) system that learns product information from product reviews and descriptions. It accordingly crafts appropriate responses to questions about the product. This system would provide instant answers to product questions allowing the consumer to be more engaged with the site and make more informed purchasing decisions.
